\usage{
check.ane(datawd, ane)
}
\arguments{
\item{datawd}{an object of class \code{windata}.}

\item{ane}{a vector of character strings with anemometers names.}
}
\value{
a data.frame with the results of annual energy production for different wind turbines models and anemometers.
}
\description{
Calculating the annual energy production of differents wind turbines to differents anemometers.
}
\details{
It's important to see what is the best fit of distribution before to calcuate the annual energy production. 
It can be seen with the function \code{plotWD(data, ane, type="fit")}
